## ✅ React
React will be used as Web Framework to easily build the SPA. As it is used by Anynines, it allows me to get into the framework since the last time I used it and to learn more about it 

### ✅ Functional Component
The documentation of React uses a lot of class-based component. But as the functional components are used at Anynines and offers a more features since React 16., they will be used on this project for learning purposes.

### ❌ Context API
### ❓ Styled Component
### ❌ Storybook

## ✅ Typescript
Typescript allows a better DX compared to Javascript: the completion and type-informations help to the development. Thus Anynines uses it too.

## ✅ React Rainbow
React Rainbow is a growing library of components.  
As the design is free, the library allows to concentrate on the architecture and main functionalities of the SPA instead of the design.
