# 0. Architecture Design Or Decision Record

Date: 2020-09-17

## Status

Living

## Context

It is useful to keep track of decisions made on the project and explain the technical choices. Thus this help to understand how the project evolves since the beginning.

## Decision

* the [template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md) made by Michael Nygard will be used since it is light and clear. There is no need for more as the project should be kept little.
* custom ADR can be used in case of need

## Consequences

Each ADR will be recorded. It will add more load to refactors or implementation of features; but in returns it will lead to better clarity of the project and encourage to think before writing code.
They will be used to explain technical choices on this pet project for Anynines.
